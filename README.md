BIM-Based Service Life Estimation (SLE) Plugin for Wood Construction
Description
The BIM-Based Service Life Estimation (SLE) Plugin is a custom Revit plugin developed to integrate service life prediction of wood construction elements directly into Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows. It provides architects, engineers, and construction professionals with data-driven insights into wood durability, enabling optimized lifecycle management and maintenance planning.

Project Background
This plugin was developed as part of the WoodLCC Project (Life Cycle Costing: Optimizing the Lifetime Performance of Timber Buildings), an initiative funded by ForestValue. The WoodLCC Project focuses on advancing service life estimation (SLE) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodologies to enhance the sustainability and durability of timber buildings.

Key Features
✔ Service Life Estimation – Predicts the lifespan of wood elements based on material properties, environmental conditions, and exposure factors.
✔ ISO 15686-4 Compliance – Implements standardized durability models for accurate and industry-aligned predictions.
✔ IFC Schema Extension – Introduces custom property sets (e.g., MaterialWoodTreatment_Pset, ServiceLifeDurationData_Pset) for seamless interoperability with BIM platforms.
✔ 3D Visualization – Displays color-coded service life results within Revit for intuitive design assessment.
✔ Automated Data Integration – Uses JSON serialization and Revit API to handle environmental and material-specific data.
✔ Lifecycle Optimization – Supports cost planning, maintenance scheduling, and sustainable decision-making.

Technical Details
Programming Language: C#
Framework: .NET 4.8.1
BIM Software: Autodesk Revit
Standards Used: ISO 15686-4, IFC4
Data Handling: JSON-based material and environmental data integration
Use Case
The plugin was validated through a case study on a wooden playhouse, demonstrating its capability to model service life variations based on design modifications, environmental exposure, and material treatments. By integrating service life estimation into BIM, this tool bridges a critical gap in durability prediction for wood construction projects.

Funding & Acknowledgment
This work was developed under the WoodLCC Project, funded by ForestValue. The project aims to optimize lifetime performance and life cycle costs for timber buildings by integrating advanced service life prediction models into BIM workflows.
